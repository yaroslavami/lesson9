                The most common doves kept as pets are the Ringneck and Diamond Doves. The Ringneck Dove has been bred in 
                40 color mutations: white, peach, fawn, and apricot, to name a few. It is also known as the laughing dove,
                collared dove, Barbary dove or turtledove.

            <h2>Sheep</h2>
            <p>A sheep or domestic sheep is a domesticated, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock.
            Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost 
            always refers to domesticated sheep. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla,
            the even-toed ungulates. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous
            species of sheep. An adult female is referred to as a ewe, an intact male as a ram, occasionally a tup, 
            a castrated male as a wether, and a young sheep as a lamb.</p>
